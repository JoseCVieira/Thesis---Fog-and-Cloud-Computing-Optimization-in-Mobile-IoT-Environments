The solution proposed in this document leverages knowledge obtained from studying several concepts and systems from the current state-of-the-art. In this section, an overview of those concepts and systems will be given, stating for each of them their advantages and disadvantages. This section is structured as follows. Section \ref{sec:Computingparadigms} presents different methods to push intelligence and computing power closer to the source of the data and why this work adopted fog computing for this purpose. Section \ref{sec:fog_architecture} describes the generic fog computing architecture, its actors and the different orchestration approaches. Section \ref{sec:Migration} discusses several optimization algorithms regarding migration of virtual resources (e.g., VM). Finally, Section \ref{sec:Toolkits} shows several open-source simulators of fog-related computing paradigms along with their characteristics.
