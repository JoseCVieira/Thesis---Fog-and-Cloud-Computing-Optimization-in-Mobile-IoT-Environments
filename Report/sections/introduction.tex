\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}
%Context - IoT
\noindent
There’s no doubt that the internet of things (IoT) is a great resource. It
comprises \textit{things} that have unique identities and are connected to the
Internet (e.g., vehicles, home appliances, wearable devices). The number of
mobile devices are predicted to reach 11.6 billion by 2021, exceeding the
world’s projected population at that time (7.8 billion), where the subset of IoT ones are expected to be 929 million \cite{CiscoVis16:online}.\\
\noindent\tab Although this kind of device has evolved radically in the last
years, battery life, computation and storage capacity remain limited. This means
that they are not suitable for running heavy applications, being necessary, in
this case, to resort to third parties.\\
%Context - CLOUD COMPUTING
\noindent\tab Cloud computing (CC) has been imperative in expanding the reach and
capabilities of IoT devices. It enables that clients outsource the allocation
and management of resources (hardware or software) that they rely upon to the
cloud. In addition, to avoid over- or under-provisioning, cloud service
providers also afford dynamic resources for a scalable workload, applying a
pay-as-you-go cost model. This way, besides overcoming the aforementioned
limitations, it also brings other advantages such as availability, flexibility,
scalability, reliability, to mention a few.\\
\noindent\tab Despite the benefits of using cloud computing, two main problems,
linked to IoT applications, remain unresolved and they can not be
underestimated. The first, and the most obvious, is the fact that cloud servers
reside in remote data centers and, consequently, the end-to-end communication
have long delays (characteristic of multi-hops transmissions over the Internet).
Some applications, with ultra-low latency requirements, can't support such
delays.  Augmented reality applications that use head-tracked systems, for
example, require end-to-end latencies to be less than 16 ms
\cite{ellis2004generalizeability}. Cloud-based virtual desktop applications
require end-to-end latency below 60 ms if they are to match QoS of local
execution \cite{taylor2015virtual}. Remotely rendered video conference, on the
other hand, demand end-to-end latency below 150 ms \cite{szigeti2005end}. The
other problem is related with the constantly growing number of IoT devices. In a
sense-process-actuate model, where the processing is done in the cloud, core
network traffic (i.e. bandwidth usage) grows depending on the number of IoT
devices.\\
\noindent\tab To overcome this limitations, the solution that has already been
proposed is to bring the cloud closer to the end devices, where entities such as
base-stations would host smaller sized clouds. This idea has been variously
termed as Cloudlets \cite{satyanarayanan2013cloudlets}, Fog Computing
\cite{bonomi2012fog}, Edge Computing \cite{davy2014challenges}, and Follow Me
Cloud \cite{taleb2013follow}, to name a few.\\
%Context - FOG COMPUTING
\noindent\tab Fog computing is a new computing architecture that aims to enable
computing, storage, networking, and data management not only in the cloud, but
also along the cloud-to-thing path as data traverses to the cloud. Fog nodes,
also known as fog servers or cloudlets (smaller sized clouds with lower
computational capacity), are virtual-machine (VM) based, which means that they
promote flexibility and mobility. They can be placed close to IoT source nodes,
due to low hardware footprint and low power consumption. This allows latency to
be much smaller, through geographical distribution, compared to traditional
cloud computing and still cut off a significant amount of core network traffic.
Nevertheless, cloud is still more suitable than fog for massive data processing,
when the latency constraints are not so tight. So even though, fog computing has
been proposed to grant support for IoT applications, it does not replace the
needs of cloud-based services. In fact, fog and cloud complement each other, and
one cannot replace the need of the other. Together, they offer services even
further optimized to IoT applications. Moreover, Internet connectivity is not
essential for the fog-based services to work, what means that services can work
independently and send necessary updates to the cloud whenever the connection is
available \cite{yousefpour2018all}.

\subsection{Motivation}\label{subsec:Motivation}
%The problem / Motivation
\noindent\tab Despite the benefits that fog promises to offer such as low
latency, heterogeneity, scalability and mobility, the current model suffer from
some limitations that still require efforts to overcome them.\\
%The problem / Motivation - MOBILE FOG COMPUTING
\noindent\tab There is lack of support for mobile fog computing. Most of the
existing literature assumes that the fog nodes are fixed, or only considers the
mobility of IoT devices \cite{yousefpour2018all}. Less attention has been paid
to mobile fog computing and how it can improve the QoS, cost, and energy
consumption. For instance, it does not foresee that a bus could have
computational power; as a cloudlet, it cloud provide offloading support to
elements (i.e. IoT devices and other cloudlets) inside and outside it. The same
could be applied to cars that are nowadays getting increasingly better in terms
of computational power. Both would be extremely useful in order to enhance the
resources and capabilities of fog computing, for example, in large urban areas
where traffic congestion is common or when they are parked. Apart from QoS
enhancement, this would reduce the implementation costs since it would no longer
require such computational power in the roadside cloudlets. Also, the costs in
terms of latency to the client would be minimized. On top of that, it would
minimize the energy consumption of mobile devices once the access points where
they are connected may be even closer.\\
%The problem / Motivation - MULTI-OBJECTIVE FOG SYSTEM DESIGN
\noindent\tab Another limitation of fog computing is to take into account few
parameters in the decision making of migration. Most of the existing schemes
that are proposed for fog systems, such as offloading, load balancing, or
service provisioning, only consider few objectives (e.g., QoS, cost) and assume
other objectives do not affect the problem \cite{yousefpour2018all}. Fog servers
are less powerful than clouds due to the high deployment cost. If many requests
are made to the same fog node at the same time, it will not have enough
computational and storage power to give a prompt response. So it raises the
question: should a service currently running in one fog node be migrated to
another one, and if yes, where? While conceptually simple, it is challenging to
make these decisions in an optimal manner. Offloading tasks to the next server
seems to be the solution, however, migrate the VM that was initially one-hop
away from the IoT device to a multi-hop away server, will increase the network
distance. Consequently, raises the end-to-end latency and the bandwidth usage by
the intermediate links. Besides, this decision still has to take into account
the cost for both the client (e.g., migration time, computational delay) and the
provider (e.g., computing and migration energy). Ignoring some of these
parameters can lead to wrong decisions, what will both violate latency
constraints of user's application and damage or defeat the credibility of fog
computing.

\subsection{Objectives}\label{subsec:Objectives}
\noindent\tab Summing up, this work intend to tackle two of the current
limitations which are, to the best of our knowledge, untreated problems in the
literature. One is to provide mobility support in fog computing environments,
not exclusively to the end devices but also to the fog nodes and the other is to
achieve multi-objective fog system design. These objectives shall be implemented
in a toolkit allowing the simulation of resource management techniques in IoT,
and mobile fog computing environments. In order to achieve the aforementioned
goals, this work must follow the sequence of tasks presented below.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Start with analysis of current mobility approaches publicly available
	with respect to IoT nodes or cloudlets;
	\item Propose mobile fog computing, where fog nodes can move, provisioning a
	method to keep the service always-available for IoT nodes;
	\item Analyze the most suitable optimization algorithms for fog computing
	and select the most appropriate ones;
	\item Design of mobility-aware task offloading when fog nodes are mobile,
	taking into account the related costs to the client (i.e. migration,
	communication and processing delay) and discovery;
	\item Propose a variation to achieve multi-objective (i.e. QoS, QoE, cost,
	handover, load balancing, energy, bandwidth and VMs or virtual objects
	migration);
	\item Study the current open source simulators for fog computing
	environments;
	\item Implement the proposed algorithms in the simulator and compare them.
