**Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers ADMM**
- Same principal of penalty methods
- Introduce another term into the cost function (Lagrange multiplier)
- Uses partial updates in Gauss-Seidel method
- Gauss-Seidel method:
	- Similar to Jacobi method to solve linear equations
	- Converge assuredly for quadratic matrices with dominant diagonal
	- Or with symmetric and positive definite

**Mixed-Integer Linear Programming**
- Linear programming maximizes (or minimizes) a linear objective function subject to one or more constraints (linear equalities/inequalities)
- Mixed integer programming adds one additional condition that at least one of the variables can only take on integer values
- Its feasible region is a convex polytopes, which is a set defined as the intersection of finitely many half spaces, each of which is defined by a linear inequality.

**Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming**
- Quadratic programming (QP) is the process of solving a (linearly constrained) quadratic optimization problem
- The problem of optimizing a quadratic function of several variables subject to linear constraints on these variables
- Quadratic programming is a particular type of nonlinear programming

**Interior Point Method**
- Barrier methods (similar to the penalty method but the barrier is in place to bias the iterates to remain away from the boundary of the feasible region)
- Class of algorithms that solve linear and nonlinear convex optimization problems

**Minimum Graph Cuts**
- Cut (a partition of the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets; that are joined by at least one edge) that is minimal in some sense.

**Lyapunov optimization**
- Lyapunov optimization refers to the use of a Lyapunov function to optimally control a dynamical system
- Ensures different forms of system stability
