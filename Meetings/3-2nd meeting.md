Otherwise, the VM has to be replicated on the fog node, or the request is forwarded to the cloud. They formulate the replica-based VM placement problem by considering the computing and storage of fog nodes, the user service constraint, as well as the edge bandwidth constraint.

2018 **Dynamic Mobile Cloudlet Clustering for Fog Computing.** ✓

Fog Computing is one of the solutions for offloading the task of a mobile. However the capability of fog server is still limited due to the high deployment cost. In this paper, is proposed a dynamic mobile cloudlet cluster policy (DMCCP) to use cloudlets as a supplement for the fog server for offloading. The main idea is that by monitoring each mobile device resource amount, the DMCCP system clusters the optimal cloudlet to meet the requests of different tasks from the local mobile device.
