**1st meeting - 04/10/2018**

- Thesis objectives
	- Provide mobility support to fog nodes (e.g., in MyiFogSim)
	- Implement an optimization algorithm based on latency (e.g., Genetic Algorithm)
	- Multi-objective optimization (e.g., QoS, QoE, Cost, Energy, Bandwidth)
	
- TODO
	- Test both iFogSim and MyiFogSim simulators
		- iFogSim: https://github.com/Cloudslab/iFogSim
		- MyiFogSim: https://github.com/marciocomp/myifogsim
		
	- Introduction of the report
		- Context: Cloud, Fog, Edge...
		- Motivation: Application examples (e.g., bus with computational resources)
		- Work objectives
