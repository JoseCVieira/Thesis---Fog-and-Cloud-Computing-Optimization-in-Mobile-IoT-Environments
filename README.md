IoT devices (e.g., sensors) are expected to generate a huge amount of data, which can be processed at a large scale in cloud resources located at remote data centers. However, some IoT control applications are sensitive to delay and would benefit from data processing closer to the IoT sensors and actuators. Fog computing brings the possibility of allocating processing resources at nodes that are closer to the end devices, reducing or avoiding the need to send the data to the cloud. The objective of this project is to optimize the allocation of Fog and Cloud resources dynamically in IoT environments with end device mobility. The algorithms will be simulated in a platform such as iFogSim. If iFogSim is selected, since iFogSim does not support mobility or the migration of resources between Fog nodes at the same level, extensions will have to be developed.
