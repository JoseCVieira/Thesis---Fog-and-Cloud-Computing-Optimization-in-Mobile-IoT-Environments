fog computing: A viewpoint of vehicles as the infrastructures. IEEE Transactions
on Vehicular Technology, 65(6):3860–3873, 2016.

4.4.1 Vehicular Fog Computing. The authors in [172, 176] proposed
the idea of vehicular fog computing (VFC) by utilizing vehicles
as the infrastructures for communication and computation. VFC
takes advantage of a dynamic group of vehicles to help increase
computational power and decrease latency issues. Different from
the vehicular cloud computing, the proposed VFC supports geodistribution,
local decision making, and real-time load-balancing.
Moreover, VFC depends on the collaboration of near-located vehicles,
instead of relying on the remote servers, which reduces the
deployment costs and delay.

5.0.9 Support of High-speed Users. Current communication protocols
that are proposed for fog computing environments do not support
high-speed users, such as users in cars, users on trains, and vehicular
computing. A research direction is to develop quick or stateless
handshake and authentication protocols for high-speed users
and automotive communication. Note that there have been already
some early efforts in this field, such as the articles [100, 145, 172];
nevertheless, we are still far from having a working and resilient

The study in [175] looks at the latency issues that may be experienced
by delay-sensitive IoT applications due to the geographical
distances between the physical IoT devices and the data centers.
The authors consider the mobile IoT federation as a service (MIFaaS)
paradigm that leverages the pool of devices managed by individual
cloud providers as a whole in order to help support delay-sensitive
applications. The network model considered is a cellular IoT environment
with multiple LTE femtocells as the network edge nodes
that supports the MIFaaS paradigm.

for 5g-enabled v2g networks. IEEE Network, 31(2):8–13, 2017.

The study in [177] argues that cloud and fog computing using
the current mobile networks may not be ideally suited to provide
the desired levels of QoS for moving electric vehicles in vehicle-togrid
(V2G) services. They propose a hybrid computing model called
“Foud,” in which the cloud and fog come together and are made
available to the V2G systems. In the proposed model, the cloud
allows virtualized computing, storage, and network resources to be
available to the V2G system entities, whereas the fog temporarily
integrates the stationary and mobile computing resources located
at the edge of V2G networks to expand the computing capacity.

Similar to VFC, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been
considered as means to provide computing capabilities [186]. In this
model, UAVs act as fog nodes and provide computing capabilities
with enhanced coverage for IoT nodes. Similarly, the concept of
vehicular micro clouds based on map information is introduced,
and, by a simulation study, investigated in [183]. Vehicular micro
clouds are virtual edge servers and are essentially clusters of cars
that help to aggregate and preprocess data that is transferred to the
cloud.

Saurez et al. propose Foglets, a programming model that facilitates
distributed programming across fog nodes [197]. Foglets
provides APIs for spatio-temporal data abstraction for storing and
retrieving application-generated data on the local nodes. Through
the Foglets API, Foglets processes are set for a certain geospatial
region and Foglets manages the application components on the Fog
nodes. Foglets is implemented through container-based visualization.
The Foglets API takes into account QoS and load balancing
when migrating persistent (stateful) data between fog nodes.

Fan et al. address the problem of placing the cloudlets to minimize
the deployment cost of cloudlet providers and to minimize the endto-
end delay of user requests [210]. Since the total deployment cost
of a cloudlet provider depends on the location of cloudlets and the
amount of resources for cloudlets, cloudlet providers must take
into account both the end-to-end delay of user requests and the
deployment cost.

Farris et al. define two integer linear programming (ILP) optimization
schemes to minimize QoE degradation and cost of replica
deployment in service replication for MEC [234]. They distinguish
classic reactive service migration from proactive migration: reactive
service migration is dependent on user movement and accommodates
this movement by locating the most suitable target edge and
then starting the process for migration; however, proactive service
migration deploys multiple replicas of the user service to neighboring
nodes. As a future direction, one could study path-oriented
proactive migration and trade-offs between the probability of reactive
migration and the cost of service replications.

Functions (GNF), a container-based NFV platform that runs
and orchestrates lightweight VNFs. They show that the presented
framework has low VNF instantiation time and memory requirements
as compared with other existing virtualization technologies,
making it suited to run on a variety of edge devices.

the demands of fog computation resources and the low-latency
requirements of mobile IoT applications. The authors propose Follow
Me Fog framework to guarantee service continuity and reduce
latency during handovers. The key idea proposed is to continuously
monitor the received signal strength of the fog nodes at the mobile
IoT device, and to trigger pre-migration of computation jobs before
disconnecting the IoT device from the existing fog node.

machine placement for backhaul traffic minimization in fog radio access networks.
In Communications (ICC), 2017 IEEE International Conference on, pages

Desc: 4.9.2 VM Placement. The paper [261] analyzes the VM placement
problem in fog radio access networks (F-RANs) with the objective
to minimize the overall back-haul traffic. The back-haul traffic is
incurred in two ways: the VM replication and data transmission
to the cloud. When a user connects to a fog node and requests an
application service, there is no back-haul bandwidth consumption
if the fog node has the application VM. Otherwise, the VM has to
be replicated on the fog node, or the request is forwarded to the
cloud. They formulate the replica-based VM placement problem by
considering the computing and storage of fog nodes, the user service
constraint, as well as the edge bandwidth constraint. Similarly, the
study [265] addresses the issues of launching VM replicas and
migrating them for latency-sensitive, computation and memory
intensive applications in a MEC environment.

4.10.3 Control and Monitoring Other Networks via Fog. Vehicular
ad hoc networks (VANETs) face many issues such as unreliable
connectivity, delay constraints, and poor scalability. The authors
of [279] suggest that using principles of fog computing along with
SDN could solve many of the current problems with VANETs. In
their architecture, the vehicles, which act as end-users, are SDN
wireless nodes. These wireless nodes send their data to Road Side
Units (RSUs) which are installed alongside road systems. Once
the data is sent to an RSU, it is then sent to an RSU controller
(RSUC) which is a cluster of RSUs connected by broadband. The
RSUC is capable of data storage and processing. Finally, the RSUCs
communicate with the SDN controller, which has global knowledge
of the VANET system.

Desc: 5.0.5 Mobile Fog Computing. Most of the existing literature assumes
that the fog nodes are fixed, or only considers the mobility
of IoT devices (e.g., [146, 291]). Less attention has been paid to mobile
fog computing and how the mobile fog nodes can improve the
QoS, cost, and energy consumption. When fog nodes are mobile,
fog resource availability, resource discovery, task offloading, and
resources provisioning will be more challenging. Mobile fog computing,
where fog nodes can move and form new networks, is an
interesting and challenging research direction. Moreover, designing
a scheme for management or federation of mobile fog nodes is
another possible direction. Along with mobile fog computing, there
needs to exist new provisioning methods for mobile fog services,
such that fog services are available for IoT nodes and users. Similarly,
one could design a task offloading and scheduling scheme
when fog nodes are mobile. An early effort for mobile fog nodes
can be found in [160].

4.12.2 Fog Resource Discovery and Selection. The paper [325] examines
the problem of discovering surrogates, which are micro-clouds,
fog nodes, or cloudlets, used by client devices to offload computation
tasks in a fog computing environment. In order to enable
the discovery and selection of available surrogates, the authors
propose a brokering mechanism in which available surrogates advertise
themselves to the broker. The broker receives client requests
and considers a number of attributes such as network information,
hardware capabilities, and distance to find the best available
surrogate for the client. The proposed mechanism is implemented
on off-the-shelf home routers.
